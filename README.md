# Reinforcement Learning Agent Learns to play Checkers

Checkers is a well-known board game. Using ma-
chine learning to develop an algorithm that can
learn games like Checkers, Chess, etc has always
been a fascination for man. Since the develop-
ment of modern computers there have been nu-
merous algorithms that are capable of performing
well against humans. However most algorithms
are articial intelligence based, in other words the
algorithm mimics human intelligence without ac-
tually learning the game. In this paper, we will
try applying reinforcement learning to develop an
agent that will learn to play checkers. We will test
its capability by letting the agent play an oppo-
nent which makes either random moves or moves
selected by an AI.
